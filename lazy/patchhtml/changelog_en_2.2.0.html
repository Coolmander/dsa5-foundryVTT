            <p>The library has new advanced filters. You can enable those with a click on the brain icon next to &quot;search&quot;. Among many other options you can search for creatures by type or Special Abilities by subcategory.
                <br> While this is a huge improvement on the usability of the library, it is still an intermmediate state. The memory footprint is still rather high and needs further improvement. Also pagination might not be perfect yet.<br> WARNING:
                It seems Firefox is creating a memory leak using the library browser if you refresh the tab too often. If you are using Firefox you might want to close the tab and reopen a new one every now and then.<br> Chromium based browsers seem to
                work fine.</p>

            <p>The journal browser now allows searching for chapter titles in books. You can additionally enable a content search with a click on the &quot;Full text search&quot; button next to the search window.<br> Moreover, the journal browser now allows
                pinning journal entries. This helps a lot if you keep forgetting that one rule and have to search it again and again or whenever you need the information of multiple pages at once for an adventure (f.e. current scene and rumors tab).<br>                To pin a journal entry open one in the browser and press the pin button or drag and drop any journal entry onto the journal browser. You can pin messages from any source. To remove pins rightclick their button in the journalbrowser.
                <br> The pinned messages can be different for each sl/player. So players can use this feature too to track important handouts or notes.</p>

    <h1 class="mume-header" id="enhancements">Enhancements</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>The behaviour of the equipment subcategory service/Dienstleistung has been changed for merchants. If you buy a service from a merchant, you won&apos;t get an item transferred to the buyer&apos;s inventory anymore. Instead a chat message stating
            the successfull trade will appear. This way you can create f.e. a horse dealer or pet shop boys with the upcoming Tiergef&#xC3;&#xA4;hrten module.</li>
        <li>The &apos;familiar&apos; trait has been migrated to Active Effects.</li>
        <li>Toggling the wear button on the character sheet now plays a small sound if you have game audio bundles installed.
        </li>
        <li>The current target will now be shown on the attack dialog.</li>
        <li>Paying and selling stuff to a merchant should play a small sound if you have game audio bundles installed.
        </li>
        <li>The /pay and /getpaid button should play a small sound if you have game audio bundles installed.</li>
        <li>The random victim button in the game master&apos;s tool now takes Misfortune into account on right click and can also be limited to a subset of selected players.</li>
        <li>A click on the name of an applied status effect on the character sheet should now open their source.</li>
        <li>There is now a setting in the options to show the modifier list for rolls on the chat cards always expanded.
        </li>
        <li>The encumbrance column on the skill section of the character sheet has been removed in favor of automation and a cleaner look.</li>
        <li>There is now a button on the gamemaster&apos;s roll dialog allowing you to enter a desired roll result. Those insolent players really need a beating. (Don&apos;t tell anyone that this can also save characters.)</li>
        <li>A treat named Begleiter/Companion will now also enable creature&apos;s advancement similar to the Familiar/Vertrauter trait (calculation of carry capacity and adventure points).</li>
        <li>A few dropdown lists should now be sorted in a more helpful manner.</li>
        <li>The /ch command can now also be used as macro. Try &quot;game.dsa5.macro.rollCh()&quot; for a simple 3d20 roll and &quot;game.dsa5.macro.rollCh(&quot;Fliegen&quot;, {modifier: 1})&quot; to set that roll up with named skill.
        </li>
        <li>The /ch command is now available in journals. See @Gc and @Rq for examples and formatting.</li>
        <li>Items with enchantments and effects now have a visual cue</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 class="mume-header" id="bufixes">Bufixes</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>The group blind roll in the game master&apos;s menu shouldn&apos;t add situtational modifiers to wrong targets anymore.
        </li>
        <li>Regeneration roll should show correct modifiers again.</li>
        <li>Poison Effects should be rollable again</li>
        <li>Arcane- and karmal energy can now also be regenerated if the lifepoint regeneration roll is zero or below.
        </li>
    </ul>
