            <p>During the process of the implementation of the Compendium I the combat system has received a lot of improvements to faciliate automation:</p>
            <h3 class="mume-header" id="subcategories-for-combat-special-abilities">Subcategories for Combat Special abilities
            </h3>

            <p>Combat Special Abilities are now separated into subcategories (f.e. special maneuever, passive). By default only one basic and special maneuver can now be selected in combat. This limitation can optionally be turned off in the configuration
                menu.

            <h3 class="mume-header" id="more-options-for-combat-special-abilities">More Options for Combat Special Abilities
            </h3>

            <p>Combat Special Abilities can now override damage values, contain damage formulas and transfer active effects similar to spells on the target among other minor improvements.</p>
            <h3 class="mume-header" id="tracking-of-ongoing-actions">Tracking of ongoing actions</h3>

            <p>The combat tracker can now show ongoing actions for combatants. The reloading action is the first element to be tracked there with preparation of spells and liturgies following in the near future.</p>

            <p>The button menu on the left side now contains the game master menu. This menu aims to help the GM in certain situations and will be expanded in future patches. For now, you can do blind rolls for all players (f.e. perception), have access
                to chat command features via buttons and distribute adventure points. Also you will get a tiny overview over the characters&apos; most important stats. This will also be the place for more advanced functions (e.g.familiars getting 25%
                AP). Feel free to add improvement proposals.</p>
